## About

<img style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;" src="https://jaredjbeck.github.io/images/IMG_1145.png"  align="right" width="200">

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Chicago Botanic Garden studying how fire influences plant reproduction and population dynamics in remnant prairies. I recently received my PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My PhD research investigated the factors influencing plant distributions and diversity in temperate forests. See [Jared's CV](/content/BECK_CV_1Dec2020.pdf).

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time outdoors: hiking, camping, canoeing, birding, botanizing, exploring the natural world, or working on restoration projects. My fascination with ducks and salamanders borders on obsession.
