I am a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying plant ecology and conservation biology. [My PhD research](/coexistence.md) focuses on patterns of coexistence and diversity in temperate forests. [Jared's CV](/content/BECK_CV_20Jan2020.pdf)

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time outdoors: hiking, camping, canoeing, birding, botanizing, and generally exploring the natural world or working on restoration projects. My fascination with ducks and salamanders borders on obsession.
