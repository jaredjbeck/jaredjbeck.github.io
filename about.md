## About

I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the Chicago Botanic Garden. My research investigates how fire influences plant reproduction and population dynamics. I received my PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I studied the distribution, demography, and diversity of herbaceous plants in temperate forests. See [Jared's CV](/content/beckCv_1November2023.pdf).

In my spare time, I enjoy birding, botanizing, and generally exploring the natural world. I have an affinity (some might say obession) for lilies, ducks, and mapping.
