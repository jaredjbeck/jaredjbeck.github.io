## Baraboo Hills Research

The Baraboo Hills and surrounding landsape support more than 1300 plant species! This represents more than 60 percent of species found in the state of Wisconsin and includes many species otherwise restricted to more northern latitudes.

See descriptions below for several research projects I have in the Baraboo Hills. Also check out my [PhD research](/coexistence).

#### Monitoring forest dynamics

#### Topography, microclimatic variation, and the distribution of plants within stream gorges
