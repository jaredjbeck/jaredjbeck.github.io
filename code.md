## R Code

### rtoybox: Jared's collection of utility functions for R

Here is an R script with utility functions I regularly use: (rtoybox.R)[http://jaredjbeck.github.io/content/rtoybox.R]

This script includes utility functions for data analysis and management as well as utility functions I use for managing, visualizing, and analyzing spatial data within the R environment. I update this script regularly and plan to integrate this code into an R package as I continue to assemble and develop functions from my work.
