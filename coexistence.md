## Plant coexistence in temperate forests

#### Examining the scale-dependent role of functional traits and phylogenetic relationships on plant community assembly

The composition and diversity of ecological communities reflects a complex set of interactions between organisms and their environment. Using extensive plant community surveys from 290 forest stands across Wisconsin, I examined how plant co-occurrence patterns were influenced by environmental conditions, functional traits, and phylogenetic relationships. 

#### Coexistence among close relatives

<img src="https://jaredjbeck.github.io/hylodesmumcoexistence.jpg" width="175" align="left"> Coexistence among closely related species poses an ecological dilemma: as a result of the evolutionary history,
close relatives often share ecological characteristics. This favors co-occurrence in suitable habitats. Yet, species 
that are too ecologically similar are expected to compete more strongly leading to competitive exclusion. I am studying
a pair of herbaceous plants, *Hylodesmum glutinosum* and *H. nudiflorum*, that co-occur regularly in eastern North American forests
to explore how physiological characteristics influence their distribution and co-occurrence patterns.

#### Soil depth and the spatial distribution of spring flowering forest herbs

<img src="https://jaredjbeck.github.io/images/mcgilvra herbs.png" width="175" align="right">To explore whether spring flowering forest herbs partition habitat at fine spatial scales, I mapped the distribution of *Hepatica acutiloba*, *Sanguinaria canadensis*, and *Trillium flexipes* within a 50 x 50 meter plot at McGilvra Woods State Natural Area (Sauk County, WI). *H. acutiloba* was restricted to shallow soils near the base of canopy trees while the distribution *S. canadensis* and *T. flexipes* did not reflect variation in soil depth of proximity to neighboring trees.

#### Variation in the strength of plant-soil feedbacks among forest herbs

Interactions between plants and soil microorganisms can influence the distribution, abundance, and diversity of plant species.
To investigate whether plant-soil feedbacks promote coexistence among temperate forest herbs, I conducted a greenhouse experiment 
growing 9 herbaceous plant species in soils with different microbial communities.
