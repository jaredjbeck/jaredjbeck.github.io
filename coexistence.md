## Plant coexistence in temperate forests

#### Functional traits, phylogenetics, and patterns of plant coexistence in temperate forests

The composition and diversity of ecological communities reflects a complex set of interactions between organisms and their environment. Using extensive plant community surveys from 290 forest stands across Wisconsin, I examined how plant co-occurrence patterns were influenced by environmental conditions, functional traits, and phylogenetic relationships. 

#### Plant-soil feedbacks and forest plant diversity

Interactions between plants and soil microorganisms can influence the distribution, abundance, and diversity of plant species.
To investigate whether plant-soil feedbacks promote coexistence among temperate forest herbs, I conducted a greenhouse experiment 
growing 9 herbaceous plant species in soils with different microbial communities.

#### Coexistence among close relatives

<img src="https://jaredjbeck.github.io/hylodesmumcoexistence.jpg" width="200" align="right"> Coexistence among closely related species poses an ecological dilemma: as a result of the evolutionary history,
close relatives often share ecological characteristics. This favors co-occurrence in suitable habitats. Yet, species 
that are too ecologically similar are expected to compete more strongly leading to competitive exclusion. I am studying
a pair of herbaceous plants, *Desmodium glutinosum* and *D. nudiflorum*, that co-occur regularly in eastern North American forests
to explore how physiological characteristics influence their distribution and co-occurrence patterns.
