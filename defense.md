Jared's PhD exit seminar will be held virtually on May 6, 2020 at 10:00 AM CDT. The defense will be hosted using Blackboard Collaborate software. To virtually attend, paste the following URL into your browser: https://us.bbcollab.com/guest/de49ec16ee364d4c95a457abfeb49d19

To ensure things run smoothly, here are a few requests/tips:
* Please consider joining the meeting a couple minutes early, this will help me sort out any last-minute technical issues
* You will need to permit the software to access your computer's microphone and camera if you want to speak/use video (it may prompt you a couple times for access which is annoying)
* Please turn off your microphone and video upon entering the virtual meeting (click on the microphone and video symbols in the lower part of the meeting window) to conserve bandwidth
* At the conclusion of my talk, there will be an opportunity to ask questions via the "chat" feature or by clicking the "raise hand" button. You can unmute yourself (microphone button at bottom of window) and turn on video (video camera buttom at bottom of window) to ask questions

Thanks!
