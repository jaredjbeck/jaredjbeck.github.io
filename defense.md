Jared's PhD exit seminar will be held virtually on May 6, 2020 at 10:00 AM CDT. The defense will be hosted using Blackboard Collaborate software. To virtually attend, paste the following URL into your browser: https://us.bbcollab.com/guest/de49ec16ee364d4c95a457abfeb49d19

To ensure things run smoothly, here are a few requests/tips:
* Please consider joining the meeting a couple minutes early, this will help me sort out any last-minute technical issues
* Please turn off your microphone and video upon entering the virtual meeting (click on the microphone and video symbols in the lower part of the meeting window), this should help us avoid problems with limited bandwidth
* At the conclusion of my talk, there will be an opportunity to ask questions via the "chat" feature or by clicking the "raise hand" button.Please mute yourself (microphone button at bottom of window) and turn off video (video camera buttom at bottom of window) during the virtual talk to conserve bandwidth.

Thanks!
