## Fire effects on plant reproduction and population dynamics in remnant prairies

<img style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;" src="https://jaredjbeck.github.io/images/jbFire2021b.jpg"  align="right" width="200"> I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the Chicago Botanic Garden studying how fire influences plant reproduction and population dynamics in remnant prairies. For this research, I am collaborating Dr. Stuart Wagenius and the [Echinacea Project](http://echinaceaproject.org/) to build on our previous work illustrating how fire synchronizes flowering and promotes successful reproduction in the pale-leaved purple coneflower (*Echinacea angustifolia*). 

Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeLBeCKDbjo) describing this research project made by Alex, a middle school teacher and RET with the Echinacea Project.

#### Fire promotes successful reproduction in *Echinacea angusitifolia*, a widespread but declining plant species

<img style="padding: 0 15px; float: left;" src="https://jaredjbeck.github.io/images/eaHegg.jpg"  align="left" width="200"> In collaboration with members of the Echinacea Project, I investigated the effects of fire on plant reproduction and population dynamics in fragmented prairies. Less than 1 percent of the once expansive tallgrass prairie remains in the upper Midwest. Most of these remnant prairies are small, isolated, losing plant species at an alarming rate (more than 1 species per year). Fire helps maintain plant diversity in these remnant prairies but its beneficial effects are not fully understood. To examine how fire affects plant reproduction and population dynamics, we monitored reproduction nearly 800 *Echinacea angustifolia* plants over a 21-year period (1996-2016). Prescribed fires stimulated flowering and synchronized reproduction in an *Echinacea* population where limited mating opportunities reduce pollination efficiency and seed production. The increase in mating opportunities after fire improved pollination and seed production. Given that many species flower in response to fire, we predict fire helps maintain plant diversity in prairies (and other fire-dependent ecosystems) not only by preventing competitive exclusion but also by enhancing seed production and promoting population growth.

#### How does fire influence plant population growth and persistence in remnant prairies?

We are experimentally burning prairie remnants in western Minnesota and collecting demographic data to parameterize population models for *Echinacea angustifolia*. These models will help us understand how and under what circumstances prescribed fire can be used to promote plant population growth and persistence in fragmented prairies.

In addition to the detailed demographic data described above, we are quantifying fire effects on the reproduction of six prairie prairie species: Narrow-leaved purple coneflower (*Echinacea angustifolia*), Rough blazing star (*Liatris aspera*), Big bluestem (*Andropogon gerardii*), Porcupine grass (*Hesperostipa spartea*), Green milkweed (*Asclepias viridiflora*), and Western red lily (*Lilium philadelphicum*).
