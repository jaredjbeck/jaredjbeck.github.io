## Ecological change

#### Dimensions of biodiversity change in temperate forests

Using detailed historic data describing forest plant communities and data from resurveys at the same sites 50 years later, we explored how plant diversity has changed in 290 forest stands across the state of Wisconsin. 

#### Understory plant responses to forest fragmentation

Habitat loss and fragmentation is considered one of the primary threats to biodiversity in ecosystems worldwide. Yet, individual species often vary in their response and sensitivity to changes in the surrounding landscape. We characterized how understory plants respond to forest fragmentation and explore whether plant responses are associated with particular characteristics using historic vegetation data and contemprorary resurveys from fragmented forests on Vancouver Island and in souther Wisconsin.
