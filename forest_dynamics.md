## Forest dynamics in the Baraboo Hills

Beginning in 2018, I established a network of 1 hectare plots within the Baraboo Hills to monitoring forest dynamics. Within each plot, my team identified, mapped, measured, and permanently tagged every tree greater than 1 centimeter DBH (a total of 4708 trees!). Additionally, we surveyed tree seedlings in ~360 quadrats, took hemisperhical photographs to quantify canopy cover, and characterized soil characteristics.
