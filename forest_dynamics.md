## Forest dynamics in the Baraboo Hills

Beginning in 2018, I established a network of 1 hectare plots within the Baraboo Hills to monitoring forest dynamics. Within each plot, my team identified, mapped, measured, and permanently tagged every tree greater than 1 centimeter DBH (a total of 4708 trees!). Additionally, we surveyed tree seedlings in ~360 quadrats, took hemisperhical photographs to quantify canopy cover, and characterized soil characteristics.

Monitoring the growth and mortality of individual trees will allow us to address many interesting questions, such as:
* What factors influence patterns of tree seedling recruitment and sapling growth?
* How do rates of tree growth and mortality vary among species and sites?
* Does tree growth or mortality vary with proximity to neighboring trees or the density of conspecific individuals?
