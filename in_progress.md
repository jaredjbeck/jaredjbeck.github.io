## Forest dynamics within Noe Woods

Noe Woods, an oak woodland within the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum. 63-year changs in the structure, composition, and dynamics of trees. 

## Functional traits, phylogenetic relationships, and *Carex* community assembly in temperate forests

33 *Carex* species across 185 forest stands in Wisconsin. We examined how the distribution of these *Carex* species was influenced by environmental conditions, the extent to which those species-environment relationships reflected functional traits or phylogenetic relationships, and how phylogenetic relationships influenced patterns of species co-occurrence. 

## Dimensions of biodiversity change in temperate forests

examine 50-year changes in the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of understory plant communites across XXX forest stands in Wisconsin.
