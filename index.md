I am a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with [Dr. Donald Waller](https://wallerlab.wiscweb.wisc.edu/) studying plant ecology and conservation biology. My research focuses on understanding what factors influence the persistence and coexistence of plant species in temperate plant communities.
