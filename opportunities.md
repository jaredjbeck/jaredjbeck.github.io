## Undergraduate research opportunities - Summer 2026!

Jared will be hiring two Undergraduate Research Assistants to __ fieldwork at the UW-Madison Arboretum during summer 2026 to assist with field research projects at the Arboretum. No prior research experience is necessary but enthusiasm for working outdoors, an interest in plant ecology, and curiosity about the natural world are essential!. Applicants must be enrolled at UW-Madison during both spring 2026 and fall 2026 to be eligible. See position description and [job posting](https://studentjobs.hr.wisc.edu/cw/en-us/job/511038).


## For prospective graduate students

Jared welcomes inquiries from prospective graduate students with interests in plant ecology, conservation biology, and ecological restoration. Prospective graduate students should share an updated CV and a brief statement of research interests with Jared via email. 

Please note that while Jared can co-advise MS and PhD students, his appointment does not allow him to serve as sole advisor. Thus prospective graduate students will need to identify a faculty member at UW-Madison to serve as a second co-advisor. Currently Jared can co-advise students through the [Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies](https://nelson.wisc.edu/graduate/) but he anticipates being able to also co-advise students through the [Department of Botany](https://botany.wisc.edu/graduate-program/) in the next year or two. Jared encourages prospective graduate students to identify potential faculty members at UW-Madison who could serve as co-advisor though this is not necessary before reaching out.



## Postdoctoral researchers

Jared welcomes inquires from prospective postdoctoral researchers who are interested in developing or co-developing funding proposals.
