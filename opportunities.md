## Undergraduate research opportunities---Summer 2026!



## For prospective graduate students
Jared welcomes inquiries from prospective graduate students with interests in plant ecology, conservation biology, and ecological restoration. Prospective graduate students should share an updated CV and a brief statement of research interests with Jared via email. 

Please note that while Jared can co-advise MS and PhD students, his appointment does not allow him to serve as sole advisor. Thus prospective graduate students will need to identify a faculty member at UW-Madison to serve as a second co-advisor. Currently Jared can co-advise students through the [Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies](https://nelson.wisc.edu/graduate/) but he anticipates being able to also co-advise students through the [Department of Botany](https://botany.wisc.edu/graduate-program/) in the next year or two. Jared encourages prospective graduate students to identify potential faculty members at UW-Madison who could serve as co-advisor though this is not necessary before reaching out.



## Postdoctoral researchers

Jared welcomes inquires from prospective postdoctoral researchers who are interested in developing or co-developing funding proposals.
