## Research

<img style="padding: 15 25px; float: right;" src="https://jaredjbeck.github.io/images/P1030137.JPG" align="right" width="200"> My research integrates observational studies of plant populations and communities, experiments ranging from small-scale greenhouse manipulations to landscape-scale fire treatments, and rigorous quantitative methods to address a variety of questions in population biology, community ecology, and conservation biology. My current postdoctoral research investigates the density-dependent effects of fire on plant reproduction and the demographic processes underlying plant community responses to fire in fragmented tallgrass prairie.
