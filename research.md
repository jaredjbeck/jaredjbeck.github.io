## Research

<img src="https://jaredjbeck.github.io/PEL_logo.png" align="right" width="100"> My research interests include a variety of topics related to population biology, community ecology, and conservation biology. For my PhD, I studied plant distributions and diversity in temperate forests. My research currently investigates how fire influences plant reproduction and population dynamics in fragmented prairies.
