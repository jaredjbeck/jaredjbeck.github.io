## Research

<img style="padding: 0 15px; float: left;"src="https://jaredjbeck.github.io/images/P1030137.JPG" align="right" width="200"> My research interests include a variety of topics related to population biology, community ecology, and conservation biology. For my PhD, I studied plant distributions and diversity in temperate forests. My research currently investigates how fire influences plant reproduction and population dynamics in fragmented prairies.
