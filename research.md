## Research

<img src="https://jaredjbeck.github.io/PEL_logo.png" align="right" width="100"> My research interests include a variety of topics related to population biology, community ecology, and conservation biology. 
For my PhD, I am studying patterns of plant coexistence and diversity in temperate forests. 
More specifically, I am exploring patterns and drivers of long-term ecological change in forest plant communities as well as 
investigating the ecological mechanisms that promote coexistence among different plant species.
