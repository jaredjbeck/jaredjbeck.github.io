## Research

<img style="padding: 15 25px; float: right;" src="https://jaredjbeck.github.io/images/P1030137.JPG" align="right" width="200"> I am a plant ecologist and conservation biologist. My research integrates observational studies of plant populations and communities, experiments at various scales, and rigorous quantitative methods to address a variety of questions related to plant population biology, community ecology, and conservation biology. For my PhD, I studied factors influencing the distribution, demography, and diversity of temperate forest plants. My current postdoctoral research investigates fire effects on plant reproduction and the demographic mechanisms underlying plant community responses to fire in fragmented tallgrass prairie.
