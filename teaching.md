Teaching and mentoring are among the most rewarding parts of my work as a scientist. I enjoy the opportunity to share my passion for the natural world with other while striving to foster curiosity and an awareness of the world that students carry with them for the rest of their lives. Since 2014, I have mentored 37 undergraduate students, served as instructor of for multiple sections of introductory biology, co-taught several field and lab courses, and taught workshops and classes open to the general public. My goal as an teacher is to provide students with a foundation in ecology, conservation, and natural history through inquiry-based instruction rooted in place. I am committed to supporting and mentoring students from diverse backgrounds.
