Teaching and mentoring are among my favorite parts of being a scientist. Since 2014, I have mentored 37 undergraduate students, served as instructor of for multiple sections of introductory biology, co-taught several field and lab courses, and taught workshops and classes open to the general public. My goal as an teacher is to provide students with a foundation in ecology, conservation, and natural history through inquiry-based instruction rooted in place. I am committed to supporting and mentoring students from diverse backgrounds.
